Each fossabans file contains a .txt of twitch usernames to mass ban using fossabot. 
In order to run the bot, first you will need to open the link to the txt file you want to run. 
Then, click on the button that says "raw". It will open up the file in a new tab and you can copy and paste the URL. 
in the twitch chat that you have channel editor privileges for, you will type (without the quotation marks) " !filesay [copied github url] "
Once that's in the chat, it'll automatically ban all the usernames on the txt file.
